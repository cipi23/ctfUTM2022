Finally, there is some light again and we are near hell. We
see the first glimpses of flames. Tall, rugged dark mountains
and rivers of fire -
INT. HELL - DAY
Now we are fully in the depths of hell. The camera MOVES
slowly, panning across the horrible landscape. The camera
continues to PAN, past a sign that reads 'Welcome to HELL!',
we can see a gathering in the distance... The camera now
TRACKS in, slowly, Finally coming to a stop on a sign that
says 'Don't Forget! It's LUAU SUNDAY!!!!'
Now we cut to the action. Everyone in hell, Satan, the
demons, lots of celebrities, tortured souls, are all gathered
for a big, festive luau!
And guess what?! Your flag is also here! Horray!
