Mimsy has small messy brown hair. In addition to his mental handicap, he appears to have strabismus in both eyes. He is overweight to the point of his shirt not being able to fit over his stomach. He wears the standard Lake Tardicaca uniform, a red t-shirt emblazoned with the Lake Tardicaca logo near the right sleeve, and brown pants. Outside of camp, he wears a white button-up shirt and brown suit. He talks in a New Jersey-esque accent.
Also he hides a flag from you!
